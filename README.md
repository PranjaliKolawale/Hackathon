# Spotify Clone Website with added features
In this project, I have built a Spotify Clone Website that replicates the clean, UI experience of Spotify while adding my unique feature named as Fun-Zone.
The Fun-Zone is an additional section within the website where users can explore and play simple, engaging games without leaving the platform. This feature is designed to make
the platform more interactive, allowing users to take short breaks, refresh their minds, and then continue enjoying their music seamlessly.
By integrating Fun-Zone with the Spotify Clone, I wanted user to play games which are related to music with their friends, colleagues and family. Games include guessing the lyrics
of the song, guessing the artists, guessing the song name, etc. this enhances user engagement by offering a place for entertainment beyond music.
